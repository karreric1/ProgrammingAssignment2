## These two functions will compute the inverse of a matrix.  If hte matrix has already been calculated and the values do not
#change, a cached copy will be called to speed up calculation time.

## The makeCacheMatrix function caches an inverse of a matrix and has one argument, x

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        

}


## The cacheSolve function computes the inverse of a matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix, has one argument, x 
##and passes variables through if needed.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
